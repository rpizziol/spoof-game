/* Spoof Game Problem
Spoof is a game played to establish who buys the next round in a pub (the looser pays for all).
Each player draws some number of coins between zero and three and holds them concealed. The game
proceeds in rounds: in a round each player guesses the total number of coins contained in all the
players’ hands. A player acts as the initiator and starts the guessing process that proceeds
clockwise until all players have guessed a number that hasn’t previously been taken. After the
guesses all players reveal their coins, the total is calculated and the player who choose the
closest number wins the round and exists the game. The others will play more rounds until only
one player is left. This player is who buys the drinks. Every time a round is played the first
player to guess a number rotates clockwise to the next available player.*/
